## Intro
Your first day should not feel like a survival test. A controlled pace gives faster progress and better memories than trying to do too much too soon.

## 1. Do not compromise on core gear
Minimum essentials:
- helmet,
- goggles,
- gloves,
- properly fitted boots.

Uncomfortable boots quickly lead to fatigue and technique mistakes.

## 2. Start with an instructor
The most expensive beginner mistake is learning from random advice. Even 1–2 hours with a coach often saves several days of trial-and-error.

## 3. Suggested first-day structure
A practical rhythm:
- short warm-up,
- 2–3 learning blocks of 20–30 minutes,
- breaks between blocks,
- finish while energy is still good.

Ending with reserve is better than overloading day one.

## 4. Do not rush to difficult terrain
Move up only when you can confidently control:
- braking,
- turning,
- speed on easy slopes.

Stable fundamentals beat fast hero moves every time.

## 5. Common beginner mistakes
- sessions that are too long,
- copying advanced friends,
- ignoring fatigue,
- no hydration/snack plan.

## 6. After the first day
- note 2–3 key mistakes to fix,
- schedule the next lesson while feedback is fresh,
- prioritize recovery (sleep, hydration, light mobility).

## Final note
A good first day means safety, manageable pacing, and clear progression. If you start right, day two already feels noticeably more confident.
