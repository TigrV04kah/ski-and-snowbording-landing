## Intro
Choosing an instructor affects not only your progress, but also your safety, mood, and how efficiently you use your time on the mountain. Gudauri has many options, so it is better to choose by clear criteria, not by the first nice photo.

## 1. Define your goal for the next 2–3 days
Before booking, answer one question: what result do you want by the end of the trip?
- confident riding on easy slopes,
- improved stance and turns,
- preparation for steeper terrain.

The clearer the goal, the easier it is to pick the right specialist.

## 2. Match the instructor to your level
A good instructor clearly states who they work with:
- beginner,
- intermediate,
- advanced.

If you are a beginner, avoid coaches focused only on advanced riders, and vice versa.

## 3. Choose the right lesson format
- **Private lessons:** faster progress and personal feedback.
- **Group lessons:** lower price, but shared pace.

For day one, beginners usually benefit most from private lessons or a very small group.

## 4. Check language compatibility
On a mountain, instructions must be quick and clear. Make sure your instructor can explain in a language you understand well.

## 5. Look for structure and safety
A quality lesson usually includes:
- a short warm-up,
- a session plan,
- clear drills,
- an end-of-session recap.

If someone pushes you to difficult terrain before assessing your level, that is a red flag.

## 6. Confirm price and conditions in advance
Check before booking:
- what is included in the lesson price,
- exact duration,
- cancellation/rescheduling terms,
- what is paid separately (lift pass, rental).

## 7. Evaluate communication speed
Fast, clear responses in WhatsApp/Telegram are often a strong signal of service quality.

## Quick booking checklist
- My level and goal match this instructor’s specialization.
- Duration and format are clear.
- Total price and extra costs are clear.
- Cancellation rules are clear.
- Communication is fast and specific.

## Final note
The best instructor is not the “most popular,” but the one who matches your level, goals, and format. Ten minutes of careful checking can save you an entire day on the slope.
